**About Me**

- My main research interest is Algebraic Geometry, especially mirror symmetry and related areas.

- Iâ€™m a third year Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics of Rutgers University. My advisor is <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/">Prof. Lev Borisov</a>. Prior to that I was an undergraduate student in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

- Besides mathematics, I'm also a great fan of classical music. <a href="https://zengruihan.github.io/music/">Here</a> are some of my favorite pieces.

- My name in Chinese characters is <img src='/images/F5DE2F02-3E7A-4294-A2ED-7FB4281DAB47.jpeg' style='transform: rotate(0deg);'>.

- Due to constant spam emails, I have had to set the strictest possible incoming mail rules for my email inbox. If you would like to reach out to me, please do NOT: 1. use personal email address (gmail, outlook, etc) 2. send me emails in Chinese.
