**About Me**

- Iâ€™m a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics of Rutgers University, working under <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/">Professor Lev Borisov</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2020.

- My main research interest is Algebraic Geometry, especially mirror symmetry and related areas. Currently I'm interested in problems related to GKZ hypergeometric systems, A-infinity categories and dg categories, categorical resolution of singularities, and invariants of algebraic varieties that are related to mirror symmetry (stringy E-function, elliptic genus, Gromov-Witten invariants etc).
