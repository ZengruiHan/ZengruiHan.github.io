**About Me**

- I'm a Brin Postdoctoral Fellow in the Mathematics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, working with [Amin Gholampour](https://math.umd.edu/~amingh/). I obtained my Ph.D. at Rutgers University in 2025 under [Lev Borisov](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2020.

- My main research interest is Algebraic Geometry, especially mirror symmetry and related areas. See [here](https://zengruihan.github.io/research/) for more details.

- I'm co-organizing the [Algebraic Geometry Seminar](https://www-math.umd.edu/research/seminars/algebraic-geometry.html) at University of Maryland College Park with Dori Bejleri, Amin Gholampour and Junyan Zhao.

- Fall 2025: learning seminar on log geometry -- [seminar website](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/log-gemetry).
