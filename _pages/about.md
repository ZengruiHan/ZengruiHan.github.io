**About Me**

- I'm a Brin Postdoctoral Fellow in the Mathematics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, working with <a href="https://math.umd.edu/~amingh/">Amin Gholampour</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. at Rutgers University in 2025 under <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/">Lev Borisov</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2020.

- My main research interest is Algebraic Geometry, especially mirror symmetry and related areas. See <a href="https://zengruihan.github.io/research/">here</a> for more details.
