**About Me**

- Iâ€™m a third year Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics of Rutgers University, and my advisor is <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/">Professor Lev Borisov</a>. Prior to that I was an undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology of China. My main research interest is Algebraic Geometry, especially mirror symmetry and related areas. Besides mathematics, I'm also a great fan of classical music.

- Due to constant spam emails, I have had to set the strictest possible incoming mail rules for my email inbox. If you would like to reach out to me, please do NOT: 1. use personal email address (gmail, outlook, etc) 2. send me emails in Chinese.
