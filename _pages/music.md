## Beethoven Symphony No.9 in D Minor 

Among all composers in history, Ludwig van Beethoven is always my favorite. His last symphony, in my opinion, is the greatest music artwork of all time which represents the peak of wisdom of human kind. My eyes are filled with tears every time I listen to this masterpiece.

## Brahms Symphony No.4 in E Minor

The best symphony after Beethoven and before Mahler. Only after I listened to it I realized why Brahms is thought to be the greatest composer after Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. The tragedy involved in 4th movement always touches me deep inside. [Click here to listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KBAy7M2w74)
