# Some of the questions that I have been thinking about:
  - Toric mirror symmetry. For example, understanding derived equivalence between different crepant resolutions of affine toric Gorenstein singularities (categorification of GKZ systems), unification of different combinatorial mirror constructions (Batyrev-Borisov and Berglund-HÃ¼bsch-Krawitz), relations to tropical geometry, etc.
  - Derived categories of algebraic varieties. For example, questions related to Kuznetsov's Homological Projective Duality, categorical resolutions and noncommutative resolution of singularities.
  - Grothendieck ring of varieties, D- and L- equivalences.

# Summary of my research papers

### Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution revisited, with Lev Borisov. In preparation.

Hanlon, Hicks and Lazarev constructed resolutions of structure sheaves of toric substacks by certain line bundles on the ambient toric stacks. In this paper, we give a new and simpler proof of a generalization of their result, which includes some non-normal cases.

### Stringy Hodge numbers of Pfaffian double mirrors and Homological Projective Duality.

### Central charges in local mirror symmetry via hypergeometric duality.

A byproduct of an (unsuccessful) attempt to construct a global integral structure for bbGKZ systems. We proved that certain A-brane integral structure defined by homology group of the complement of an affine hypersurface in algebraic torus is equivalent to the B-brane integral structure defined by the Grothendieck group of the corresponding toric CY.

### Analytic continuation of better-behaved GKZ systems and Fourier-Mukai transforms.

### On hypergeometric duality conjecture, with Lev Borisov.
We construct explicit non-degenerate pairing between solution spaces of bbGKZ systems in arbitrary dimensions, which can be seen as a globalization of the Euler pairing on derived categories of toric CYs.


### On duality of certain GKZ hypergeometric systems, with Lev Borisov and Chengxi Wang.
An undergrad research project. We settled the hypergeometric duality conjecture in dim 2 by a direct computation.
