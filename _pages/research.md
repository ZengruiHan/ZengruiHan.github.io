## Some of the questions that I have been thinking about:
  - Toric mirror symmetry. For example, understanding derived equivalence between different crepant resolutions of affine toric Gorenstein singularities (categorification of GKZ systems), unification of different combinatorial mirror constructions (Batyrev-Borisov and Berglund-HÃ¼bsch-Krawitz), relations to tropical geometry, etc.
  - Derived categories of algebraic varieties. For example, questions related to Kuznetsov's Homological Projective Duality, categorical resolutions and noncommutative resolution of singularities.
  - Grothendieck ring of varieties, D- and L- equivalences.

## Summary of my research papers

#### Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution revisited, with Lev Borisov. In preparation.

#### Stringy Hodge numbers of Pfaffian double mirrors and Homological Projective Duality.

#### Central charges in local mirror symmetry via hypergeometric duality.

#### Analytic continuation of better-behaved GKZ systems and Fourier-Mukai transforms.

#### On hypergeometric duality conjecture, with Lev Borisov.

#### On duality of certain GKZ hypergeometric systems, with Lev Borisov and Chengxi Wang.
