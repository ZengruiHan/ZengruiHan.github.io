Some of the questions that I have been thinking about:
  - Toric mirror symmetry. For example, understanding derived equivalence between different crepant resolutions of affine toric Gorenstein singularities (categorification of GKZ systems), unification of different combinatorial mirror constructions (Batyrev-Borisov and Berglund-HÃ¼bsch-Krawitz), relations to tropical geometry, etc.
  - Derived categories of algebraic varieties. For example, questions related to Kuznetsov's Homological Projective Duality, categorical resolutions and noncommutative resolution of singularities.
  - Grothendieck ring of varieties, D- and L- equivalences.
