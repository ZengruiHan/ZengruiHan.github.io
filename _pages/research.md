## Elliptic genera of Pfaffian-Grassmannian double mirrors
**In progress.**

The Pfaffian-Grassmannian double mirror is the first example of derived-equivalent Calabi-Yau varieties but not birationally equivalent. They appear as different geometric phases of certain nonabelian gauged linear sigma models (nonabelian GLSM). It is believed that their mirror-symmetry-theoretic invariants (such as stringy Hodge numbers, elliptic genus, Gromov-Witten theory etc) should be equivalent. In this project we aim to prove that their elliptic genera coincide.

## Stringy Hodge numbers of generalized Pfaffian double mirrors
**In preparation.**

The generalized Pfaffian double mirror is a generalization of the Pfaffian-Grassmannian double mirror. In the case of odd dimensions, Borisov and Libgober studied the stringy Hodge numbers on the two sides. This paper could be seen as a generalization of their result in the sense that we include the even dimensional cases, and allow the dimension of the generic subspace to vary, which is a crucial ingredient in the definition of the double mirror construction. We also make connections to Kuznetsov's Homological projective duality (HPD) for Pfaffian varieties.

## Central charges in local mirror symmetry via hypergeometric duality 
**[arXiv:2404.16258](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16258)**. Submitted.

In this paper we study central charges of Hori-Vafa mirror pairs, where the A-model is given by a family of affine hypersurfaces in an algebraic torus and the B-model is given by toric Calabi-Yau orbifolds.  We combine the tropical method of Abouzaid-Ganatra-Iritani-Sheridan and the hypergeometric duality of Borisov and myself to settle [Hosono's conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0404043). This could also be viewed as a generalization of the Gamma conjecture within the context of local mirror symmetry.

## Analytic continuation of better-behaved GKZ systems and Fourier-Mukai transforms
**Under minor revision at Épijournal de Géométrie Algébrique. [arXiv:2305.12241](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12241).**

A companion paper to the paper "On hypergeometric duality conjecture". We settled the analytic continuation conjecture of Borisov-Horja in full generality. We use the tool of Mellin-Branes integral to compute analytic continuations of hypergeometric series.

## On hypergeometric duality conjecture
**Joint with Lev Borisov, Advances in Mathematics, Volume 442 (2024), 109582. [arXiv:2301.01374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01374) [journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870824000975)**

In this paper we settled the duality conjecture in Borisov-Horja in full generality. We construct an explicit non-degenerate pairing between the solution spaces of the bbGKZ D-modules and its holonomic dual. The novelty of this paper lies in the relationship between our formula for the pairing and the resolution of diagonal formula for toric varieties of [Fulton-Sturmfels](https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9403002).

## On duality of certain GKZ hypergeometric systems
**Joint with Lev Borisov and Chengxi Wang, Asian Journal of Mathematics, Volume 25 (2021), No.1, 65-88. [arXiv:1910.04039](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04039) [journal](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/ajm/content/vols/0025/0001/a005/index.php)**

An undergraduate research project. We studied [two conjectures of Borisov and Horja](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2238) on the better-behaved GKZ systems, and proved them in the 2-dimensional case.
