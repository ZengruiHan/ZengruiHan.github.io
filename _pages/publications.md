### Central charges in local mirror symmetry via hypergeometric duality 
Forthcoming. (Draft available upon request)
- In this paper we study the central charges of Hori-Vafa mirror pairs, where the A-model is given by a family of affine hypersurfaces in algebraic torus and the B-model is given by toric Calabi-Yau orbifolds.  We combine the [tropical method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02177) of Abouzaid-Ganatra-Iritani-Sheridan and the [hypergeometric duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01374) of Borisov and myself to settle a [conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0404043) of Hosono. This could also be seen as a generalization of the Gamma conjecture for the local mirror symmetry setting.

### Analytic continuation of better-behaved GKZ systems and Fourier-Mukai transforms 
Under minor revision at Épijournal de Géométrie Algébrique. [arXiv:2305.12241](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12241). 
- A companion paper to the paper "On hypergeometric duality conjecture". We settled the analytic continuation conjecture in [Borisov-Horja](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2238) in full generality. We use the tool of Mellin-Branes integral to compute analytic continuations of hypergeometric series.

### On hypergeometric duality conjecture
Joint with Lev Borisov, Advances in Mathematics, Volume 442 (2024), 109582. [arXiv:2301.01374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01374) [journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870824000975)
- In this paper we settled the duality conjecture in [Borisov-Horja](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2238) in full generality. We construct an explicit non-degenerate pairing between the solution spaces of the bbGKZ D-modules and its holonomic dual. The novelty of this paper lies in the relationship between our formula for the pairing and the resolution of diagonal formula for toric varieties of [Fulton-Sturmfels](https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9403002).

### On duality of certain GKZ hypergeometric systems
Joint with Lev Borisov and Chengxi Wang, Asian Journal of Mathematics, Volume 25 (2021), No.1, 65-88. [arXiv:1910.04039](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04039) [journal](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/ajm/content/vols/0025/0001/a005/index.php)
- An undergraduate research project. We studied [two conjectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2238) of Borisov and Horja on the better-behaved GKZ systems, and proved them in the 2-dimensional case.
